i like building software and community through code and sysadmin tools.
my current day job involves writing c# for desktop applications.
my primary hobby project is [tilde.team](https://tilde.team/),
a non-commercial public access unix system focused on teaching, learning,
and building community.

some fun facts about me:

- i'm left handed
- i love to travel and have lived in ecuador and switzerland
- i tend to avoid uppercase letters if i can help it
